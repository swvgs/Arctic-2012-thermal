Arctic-2012-thermal
===================
This is Andrew Vaccaro's thermal processing script that was made to work with raw data from Therma.

As of 5/2/13, these scripts are in a preliminary stage. They are only run from the command line and require Python 2 to be installed. Later versions will "hopefully" be stand-alone and have a GUI.

TIM.py takes original data files and splits them into multiple files, each one containing the data along one survey line. TIM_2.py takes the data files and processes them down to an equivalent number of data points between each survey marker.

Currently, an unknown error prevents all of the code from being run in the same file. Not entirely sure why, but splitting into two files works (thanks, CJ). That being said, all file names and numbers are hard-coded into the scripts. Annoying, but it's fairly simple to go in and edit the file name in TIM.py and then the number of files produced in TIM_2.py.
